        I played soccer for one year in 5th grade. Following 8th grade, I went to Academy of American Studies. In my freshman year, I joined Student Government and the schools softball team. During my sophomore year, I joined the girl's soccer team at my school. Outside of school I play video games and watch numerous shows on netflix.
        Some shows I watch are Teen Wolf, Prison Break, Orange is the New Black, the Challenge, and
One fun fact about me is that I was born in New Jersey and lived there for a few months. Some things I like are video games, pizza, softball, soccer, and sleeping. Some things I dislike are public speaking , healthy food, and stress.
